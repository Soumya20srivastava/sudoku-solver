What you see:

When you open the webpage, you'll see a heading saying "Sudoku Solver", a grid where you can enter numbers for the Sudoku puzzle, and a button labeled "Solve".
How it works:

When you click the "Solve" button, the program will try to solve the Sudoku puzzle for you.
It looks at the numbers you've entered into the grid and starts solving the puzzle using a smart method called backtracking. This method tries different numbers until it finds a solution.
If it finds a solution, it fills in the grid with the solved numbers. If it can't find a solution, it will let you know.
What happens behind the scenes:

The program is written in three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML creates the structure of the webpage, like headings and buttons.
CSS makes the webpage look nice by adding colors and styles.
JavaScript does the heavy lifting. It's like the brain of the program. It handles things like checking if the numbers you've entered are correct and solving the puzzle.
The puzzle-solving logic:

JavaScript has special functions to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It starts by finding an empty spot in the grid (a cell where you haven't entered a number yet).
Then, it tries different numbers in that spot, one by one. For each number, it checks if it's allowed according to Sudoku rules. If it's not allowed, it tries the next number.
It keeps trying different numbers until it finds one that works. If it can't find any valid numbers, it goes back and tries a different number in the previous spot. This is called backtracking.
It keeps doing this until the puzzle is solved or until it realizes there's no solution.
thats it
